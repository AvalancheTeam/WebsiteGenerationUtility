# WebsiteGenerationUtility
Made originally by L33T...ps love you hommies


i suggest you will modify after generation from ur own tool in website repo...
this can be modified to be our own modification tools and we can add to the code and make this larger

i am a professional C developer its very similar to java u will see in the projects

tool1.c is for writing all the website files
	todo:  
       * we must add a filebased databse of our pages, theres a page generation utility and 3 features within this
		* has nice implemented menu for you i believe u can add to it with api GPT 3.5-turbo loves this code XD
tool2.c We need to edit files before we use tool1.c this will read .php .aspx files for website or whatever we already use can be imported to the project easily
	TODO:
		*SYNTAX READING AND DESIGN THE WHOLE IDEA
		* READ FROM OUR ALREADY PRODUCED FILES AND EDIT THESE CUSTOM FILE DATABASES.
			* SIGNUP.CWGUCFG,INDEX.CWGUCFG,HOMEPAGE.CWGUCFG AND THATS CONTAINING ALL OF THE WEBSITE DATA IS NICE IDEAS
			* MAKE SOME IDEAS HERE AND DOCUMENT A TODO LIST IN README.MD I WOULD PREFER
		* READ ALREADY MADE WEBSITE DATA AND PARSE TO OUR CUSTOM MADE EDITING FILE DATABASE
			* BASICALLY THE TITLE
		* DUPLICATE A PAGE AND USE ITS METRICS SPECIALLY PARSED TO EDIT PAGES WITH POSITIONAL DATA AND TERMINAL QUESTIONS
			* PAGE UI IS LAYED OUT SOMEWHERE IN THE TOOLS WITH ai HELP I DID ALOT
